## 2. Development of End-to-End Machine Learning System

Welcome to the "Development of End-to-End Machine Learning System" submodule. In this section, we will guide you through the process of creating a simple yet effective machine learning model for combustion optimization and deploying it on your localhost system.

### Module Overview:

1. **Simple Machine Learning Model:**
   - Learn the basics of choosing a suitable algorithm for combustion optimization.
   - Understand the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
   - Implement a simple ML model using popular libraries such as scikit-learn.
2. **Local Deployment:**
   - Explore the steps involved in setting up a local development environment.
   - Understand how to expose your ML model as a web service on your localhost.
   - Test and validate your model locally to ensure it functions as expected.

### Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   - If you haven't already, make sure to clone the main repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ichsansan/COPT-Training-Module.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Development Submodule:**

   - Move to the submodule dedicated to development.

   ```bash
   cd "COPT-Training-Module/Module 2 - End-to-End ML System"
   ```
